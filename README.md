# Installing

1. Go to your phone's Settings app and open the Security settings.
2. Enable Unknown sources. Click "OK". (It only needs to be enabled to install Autogyro; you can disable it immediately afterwards if you want.)
3. [Download the latest version of Autogyro here (you'll need the `.apk` file.)](https://github.com/zlsa/autogyro/releases/latest).
4. Open the file and allow Android to install the app.
5. When you first run Autogyro, you'll need to grant two permissions.
6. You're good to go! If you're using Android 7.0 or above (Nougat),
   there are Quick Settings tiles as well.
